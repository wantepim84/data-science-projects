Introduction
A NetworkX specialist with algorithmic expertise, I bring precision and creativity to network analysis and visualization tasks. As a seasoned professional, I excel in transforming complex data into clear, insightful visualizations, ensuring clients gain valuable insights.

This repository contains scripts and tools for data science and network visualization and analysis using Python's NetworkX. I specialize in fulfilling networking/graph requirements, performing required analysis on graphs, and representing them using Matplotlib.

Features
Network Representation: Visualize complex networks using NetworkX.
Path Analysis: Perform detailed path analysis to find shortest paths, all paths, and other path-related queries.
Node/Edge Analysis: Analyze nodes and edges to extract meaningful metrics and insights.
Customization: Tailored network analysis and visualization according to specific requirements.
Installation
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
Create and activate a virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Example Scripts
Network Representation:

python
Copy code
import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

G = nx.karate_club_graph()
nx.draw(G, with_labels=True)
plt.show()
Path Analysis:

python
Copy code
import networkx as nx

G = nx.karate_club_graph()
path = nx.shortest_path(G, source=0, target=33)
print("Shortest path:", path)
Node/Edge Analysis:

python
Copy code
import networkx as nx

G = nx.karate_club_graph()
degrees = dict(G.degree())
print("Node degrees:", degrees)
Custom Analysis
For custom network analysis and visualization, you can modify the scripts or create new ones according to your requirements. Detailed documentation for NetworkX can be found here.
